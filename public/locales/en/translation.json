    "description": "Dear friend who is reading this, welcome to my digital space! Iâ€™m Katarzyna, a React Developer, ready to take on challenges. After spending several years as a consultant on digital transformation projects in Paris and contributing to a business involving the management of a CMS web platform, I decided to dive deeply into the fascinating world of technology. I graduated with a bachelor's degree as a JavaScript React Developer and fell in love with React. Now, I continue to polish my skills by bringing new React projects to life but also discovering the mysteries of the back-end."
